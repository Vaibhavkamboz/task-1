# task-1
This Python program implements a basic To-Do List where users can add, view, remove, and save tasks. The tasks are stored in a text file (tasks.txt) so they persist even after the program is closed. It uses simple Python concepts like lists, loops, file handling, and functions to manage the to-do list.
